# Digital Proficiency Kit (DPK)

## Enabling STEAM Learning Through the Open Web

Martti Raavel, Tiina Alasoo

<!-- Speaker Notes: Opening: Welcome partners. Purpose: showcase what we've built, how it's structured, how to engage. -->

---

## Vision & Purpose

- Empower teachers & students to create meaningful web artefacts
- Integrate HTML/CSS/JS skills into interdisciplinary STEAM contexts
- Build digital competence aligned to DigComp 2.2 (creation, problem solving, collaboration)
- Keep everything lightweight: runs in any modern browser (no build pipeline)
<!-- Speaker Notes: Stress accessibility, low barrier, standards-based approach. -->

---

## What We've Built So Far

- Core module set (01–07): Intro, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Data Viz, Creative Projects, Green STEAM Challenge
- Each module: outcomes, example code, guided practice, independent tasks, teacher notes
- Parallel Teacher Toolkit: lesson plans, rubrics, adaptation guidance
- Foundation docs: competence map, curriculum map, conceptual framework
<!-- Speaker Notes: Highlight breadth & scaffolded progression. -->

---

## Repository Architecture (Learner Side)

`digital-proficiency-kit/`

- `modules/01-introduction-to-the-web/` → units, examples, tasks, teacher-notes
- Consistent folder naming: lowercase, hyphenated
- `docs/` → competence-map, curriculum-map, conceptual-framework
- `assets/` → shared images/media
<!-- Speaker Notes: Simplicity encourages contributions & classroom usage. -->

---

## Module Anatomy

- Units: `unit-X.Y-topic.md` (concept focus, outcomes, tutorial narrative)
- Examples: runnable `.html` / `.css` / `.js` snippets (semantic, accessible)
- Tasks: guided + independent creation with acceptance criteria
- Teacher Notes: differentiation, assessment suggestions, reflection prompts
<!-- Speaker Notes: Reinforces reusability and predictability for educators. -->

---

## Pedagogical Framework & Competence Mapping

- DigComp 2.2 alignment: content creation, collaboration, safety, problem solving
- Learning outcomes use action verbs (describes, constructs, implements)
- Progression: conceptual understanding → structured practice → creative application → reflection
- Embedded reflection prompts to consolidate metacognition
<!-- Speaker Notes: Show educational rigor underpinning technical content. -->

---

## Teacher Toolkit (Companion Repository)

- Mirrors module numbering for quick cross-reference
- Provides: module overviews, unit lesson plans, assessment rubrics
- Emphasis on adaptability (mixed ability, time constraints, hybrid learning)
- Encourages teacher professional reflection & iterative improvement
<!-- Speaker Notes: Partnership value: supports implementation, not just content. -->

---

## Achievements (To Date)

- Structured multi-module scaffold completed
- Integrated teacher materials
- Established consistent naming & folder conventions

<!-- Speaker Notes: Replace with concrete metrics (e.g., classrooms piloted, contributors) before presentation if available. -->

---

## To Do Next

- Supporting learning materials for teachers
- ...

## Thank You!
